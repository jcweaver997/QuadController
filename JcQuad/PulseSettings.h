// When transmitting with a single pin, the minimum space signal that marks
// the end of a frame. Single wire receivers recognize the end of a frame
// by looking for a gap longer than the maximum data size. When viewing the
// waveform on an oscilloscope, set the trigger "holdoff" time to slightly
// less than TX_MINIMUM_SPACE, for the most reliable display. This parameter
// is not used when transmitting with 2 pins.
#define TX_MINIMUM_SPACE 5000.0

// The minimum total frame size. Some servo motors or other devices may not
// work with pulses the repeat more often than 50 Hz. To allow transmission
// as fast as possible, set this to the same as TX_MINIMUM_SIGNAL.
#define TX_MINIMUM_FRAME 20000.0

// The length of all transmitted pulses. This must be longer than the worst
// case interrupt latency, which depends on how long any other library may
// disable interrupts. This must also be no more than half TX_MINIMUM_SIGNAL.
// Most libraries disable interrupts for no more than a few microseconds.
// The OneWire library is a notable exception, so this may need to be lengthened
// if a library that imposes unusual interrupt latency is in use.
#define TX_PULSE_WIDTH 100.0

// When receiving, any time between rising edges longer than this will be
// treated as the end-of-frame marker.
